ETHICAL HACKING: ASSIGNMENT 1 
LINUX HELP CHAT USING GROQ API 
 METHODOLOGY 
This help chat demonstrate a constraint-driven development methodology with a 15
line Python code limit. It also combines an API first architecture using Groqâ€™s cloud AI 
service. 
FINDINGS 
We can use AI to develop effective teaching resources that will make cybersecurity 
education much easier and more accessible. AI APIs result in improved academic 
performance. 
CONCLUSION 
Learning how to begin projects, and more especially, how to build an AI chatbot, was 
made possible by this project. Additionally, I learned how to use APIs. All things 
considered, this project was a fantastic learning experience that exposed me to a 
variety of technologies that will undoubtedly be useful in my future professional 
endeavours.
